# cli_helper.rb

I had this code just being lazy on my computer.  It might be of use
to someone else; but, its just really intended to support my own
quick and dirty command-line based utilities.  Mostly they are one-offs
but sometimes they hang around.

I typically create thes cli utilities using my own code generater which
resulted in lots of duplicate source blocks roll around on the deck.  This
little library will DRYup my code a little.


## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here in case someone can't figure it out
      for themselves.
